A simple Qt rich-\/text editor widget, easy to use in any Qt project.



The icons used are standard icons from theme as defined by \href{http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html}{\tt freedesktop.\+org Icon Naming Specification} (which lacks button/ordered list icons).

The editor automatically converts plain text http(s) links and emails to html links in to\+Html().
